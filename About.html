        <h2>About envision</h2>
        <p>In the world full of Data and Information , you have to deal with lots of things. <br> Suppose there's a pool of random data and you want to look for some perticular data then you surely find it difficult to get that data. So, it's better to have sorted data for the convenience and that's where the sorting algorithms comes into play. <br><br> Unfortunately sometimes understanding an algorithm becomes complicated because we are unable to visualize the working behind it. Here at envision you can visualize the working of each algorithms. This makes it more natural for the human mind to comprehend and therefore makes it easier to understand. </p>
